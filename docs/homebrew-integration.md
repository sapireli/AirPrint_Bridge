# üç∫ Homebrew Integration

AirPrint Bridge is available through Homebrew, making installation and updates simple and reliable.

## What is Homebrew?

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software. It provides:

- **Easy Installation**: One command to install software
- **Automatic Updates**: Simple commands to keep software up to date
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically handles software dependencies
- **Clean Uninstallation**: Easy removal of installed software

## Installation via Homebrew

### Quick Install

```bash
# Add the tap and install
brew tap sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge https://github.com/sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge.git
brew install airprint-bridge
```

**Note**: The explicit HTTPS URL ensures the tap works without requiring git authentication credentials, even though the repository is public.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Add the tap** (if not already added):
   ```bash
   brew tap sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge https://github.com/sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge.git
   ```

2. **Install AirPrint Bridge**:
   ```bash
   brew install airprint-bridge
   ```

3. **Test the installation**:
   ```bash
   sudo airprint-bridge -t
   ```

4. **Install the service**:
   ```bash
   sudo airprint-bridge -i
   ```

## Benefits of Homebrew Installation

```bash
# Update Homebrew and upgrade AirPrint Bridge
brew update
brew upgrade airprint-bridge
```

## Troubleshooting

### Git Authentication Issues

If you encounter git authentication prompts when tapping:

```bash
# Force HTTPS instead of SSH
git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:

# Clear any cached credentials
git config --global --unset credential.helper

# Then try tapping again
brew tap sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge https://github.com/sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge.git
```

### Alternative Tapping Method

If you continue to have issues, you can also clone and tap locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge.git
cd AirPrint_Bridge

# Tap from local directory
brew tap sapireli/AirPrint_Bridge .

# Install
brew install airprint-bridge
```

## Using AirPrint Bridge with Homebrew

### Command Reference

All AirPrint Bridge commands work the same way with Homebrew installation:

```bash
# Test functionality
sudo airprint-bridge -t

# Install the service
sudo airprint-bridge -i

# Uninstall the service
sudo airprint-bridge -u

# Show help
airprint-bridge --help

# Show version
airprint-bridge --version
```

### File Locations

With Homebrew installation, files are installed to standard locations:

- **Executable**: `/usr/local/bin/airprint-bridge`
- **Documentation**: `/usr/local/share/doc/airprint-bridge/`
- **License**: `/usr/local/share/airprint-bridge/LICENSE`

### Service Management

The service is managed through `launchd` and works identically to manual installation:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo launchctl list | grep airprint

# View service logs
sudo log show --predicate 'process == "airprint_bridge"'
```

## Updating AirPrint Bridge

### Automatic Updates

Homebrew makes updating simple:

```bash
# Update Homebrew's package database
brew update

# Upgrade AirPrint Bridge to the latest version
brew upgrade airprint-bridge

# Or upgrade all packages including AirPrint Bridge
brew upgrade
```

### What Happens During Updates

1. **New Version Download**: Homebrew downloads the latest version
2. **Service Uninstallation**: The old service is automatically uninstalled
3. **New Version Installation**: The new version is installed
4. **Service Reinstallation**: You'll need to reinstall the service:
   ```bash
   sudo airprint-bridge -i
   ```

### Checking for Updates

```bash
# Check if updates are available
brew outdated

# See what would be updated
brew upgrade --dry-run
```
